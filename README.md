# React Sandbox

This is my sandbox to. You can find a [live demo here](https://some-sandbox.netlify.app/)

So far I've used dummyjson API and poke API.

Stuff I tried so far:
-Redux Tool Kit
-RTK Query
-Axios library to perform some fetches
-Context to build auth functionality
-Context and useReducer to build a shopping cart
-i18n to test multi language stuff
