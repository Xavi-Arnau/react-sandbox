# React Sandbox

This is my sandbox to try some stuff. You can find a [live demo here](https://some-sandbox.netlify.app/)

I've used dummyjson API and poke API.

Stuff I tried so far:

-Redux Tool Kit

-RTK Query

-Axios library to perform some fetches

-Context to build auth functionality

-Context and useReducer to build a shopping cart

-i18n to test multi language stuff

-Using an express.js API made by myself
